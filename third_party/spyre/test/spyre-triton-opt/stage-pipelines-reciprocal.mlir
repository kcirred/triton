// That a division by one leaves the stage as the unary intrinsic, with no float
// immediate anywhere -- and that no other pass in the stage is load-bearing for
// it.
//
// No single pass can make this claim, which is why it is here. LowerSpyreOps'
// divf rule chooses between the unary and the binary intrinsic, so what is under
// test is not that choice -- that is the pass's own test -- but that the stage
// delivers a body in the form the rule can read at all.
//
// WHY THE CONSTANT HAS TO GO. A float immediate reaching a Spyre compute unit is
// not read back as it was written, so a divide by a rounded one is not the divide
// that was written. Nothing downstream refuses it -- dbo-opt has no diagnostic for
// a float immediate operand -- so a regression here is a wrong answer, not a
// failure. `reduce/softmax_on_stick` is the kernel that depends on it; this file is
// the same claim at a size a lit test can read.
//
// THE LAST TWO RUN LINES ARE THE INTERESTING ONES. They assert a NON-dependency,
// and only for this rule: the reciprocal reads its numerator through the generic's
// body, so a splat `ins` and a folded-in scalar constant answer the same question,
// and dropping FuseComputeAndDataMovement leaves the result identical. Matching on the body
// value instead would make that pass load-bearing here -- it is the only thing in
// the pipeline that folds a splat constant into a body -- and the failure would
// surface as a numerical answer rather than as a diff. The two prefixes are reused
// rather than given negated twins precisely so the two spellings cannot drift.
//
// The compare rule is the opposite case and is NOT covered here: it genuinely
// needs FuseComputeAndDataMovement, because its group spans two tensor ops and arrives as
// two generics. test/Transforms/LowerSpyreOps/compare.mlir names that pass in its
// own RUN line for exactly that reason.
//
// The kernel is the smallest thing carrying the shape: a 1-D reciprocal whose
// numerator is a splat `arith.constant` beside the divide, which is how
// `tl.full([N], 1.0)` arrives. No descriptor layout and no reduce -- what is under
// test is the sequence, not what any one pass does to a compute op.
