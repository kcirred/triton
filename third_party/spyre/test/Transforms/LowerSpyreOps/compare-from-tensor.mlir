// The compare rule: a comparison whose answer is wanted as a NUMBER rather than as
// a flag. `arith.cmpf` + `arith.uitofp` is the mask shape -- `(m != 0)` used
// multiplicatively -- and `spyreop.compare` is one op that does it, its answer
// coming "in the width compared rather than as a boolean".
//
// Why the pair is one choice and not two: `arith.cmpf` alone gives an `i1`, which
// no spyreop op produces and the device cannot represent in a compute body, so the
// compare is not selectable by itself. What consumes the `i1` decides what the
// pair becomes.
//
// THE SHAPE THE PIPELINE REALLY PRODUCES, which is why this case is in a file of
// its own: a rule matches ops in ONE body, and ConvertElementwiseToLinalg gives
// every tensor-level op a body of its own, so this group starts out spread over TWO
// generics with a `tensor<i1>` between them. No rule can see that.
// FuseComputeAndDataMovement is what brings it together.
//
// One module per file here, because the interesting claim is "ONE generic comes
// out" and a -NOT directive asserting that cannot be scoped to one module in a
// -split-input-file run: it would scan on into the next.
//
// compare.mlir hand-builds the fused body instead, isolating each rule decision
// from whether fusion happened; compare-invalid.mlir holds the refusals.

// Two tensor ops, and therefore two generics with a `tensor<4xi1>` between them
// until the fusion pass fuses across the `i1`. Out comes ONE generic holding one
// intrinsic, and no `i1` of any kind -- neither as a tensor nor in a body.
